jdk has jre(jvm+ libraries)

u write code in java(.java)--using compiler u convert into byte code(javac converts .java to .class file)
this byte code or .class file is given to JVM/JRE and it executes/runs our code

java is platform independent-- it means the same code works in all OS , all hardware

java feature--WRITE ONCE READ ANYWHERE(COMPILE ONCE, U CAN EXECUTE IT ANYWHERE)

jshell in cmd
u willget an interactive java console 

//first program
java is OOP so declare a class

// EXECUTION STARTS FROM main
//EVERY LINE(NOT BLOCK) has to end with ;

class Hello
{
    public static void main(String a[])
    {
        System.out.print("HI");   //STANDARD STATEMENT TO PRINT ANYTHING
    }
}

//to store variables--data types
         datatypes

   primitive
   1.int(short,int long,byte) byte(from -2^7 to 2^7-1)
   2.float(double,float)---by default in java double, to use float explicitly u have to mention float x=2.3f;
   3.char--2 bytes(in c, cpp char has 1 Byte)--as java supports unicode not ascii only char c='K'; //SNGLE QUOTES ONLY
   4.Boolean(True/False)  not 1/0
